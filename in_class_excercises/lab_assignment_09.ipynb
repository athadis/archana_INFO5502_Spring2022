        "Punishment for crime has many [philosophical justifications](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/#ThePun).  An important one is that fear of punishment may *deter* people from committing crimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the United States, some jurisdictions execute people who are convicted of particularly serious crimes, such as murder.  This punishment is called the *death penalty* or *capital punishment*.  The death penalty is controversial, and deterrence has been one focal point of the debate.  There are other reasons to support or oppose the death penalty, but in this project we'll focus on deterrence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key question about deterrence is:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Through our exploration, does instituting a death penalty for murder actually reduce the number of murders?\n",
        "\n",
        "You might have a strong intuition in one direction, but the evidence turns out to be surprisingly complex.  Different sides have variously argued that the death penalty has no deterrent effect and that each execution prevents 8 murders, all using statistical arguments!  We'll try to come to our own conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The data\n",
        "\n",
        "The main data source for this lab comes from a [paper](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) by three researchers, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd.  The dataset contains rates of various violent crimes for every year 1960-2003 (44 years) in every US state.  The researchers compiled the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since crimes are committed by people, not states, we need to account for the number of people in each state when we're looking at state-level data.  Murder rates are calculated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{murder rate for state X in year Y} = \\frac{\\text{number of murders in state X in year Y}}{\\text{population in state X in year Y}}*100000$$\n",
        "\n",
        "(Murder is rare, so we multiply by 100,000 just to avoid dealing with tiny numbers.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Murder rates vary over time, and different states exhibit different trends. The rates in some states change dramatically from year to year, while others are quite stable. Let's plot a couple, just to see the variety.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Hint*: To create two lines, you will need create the table `ak_mn` with two columns of murder rates, in addition to a column of years. This table will have the following structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Year | Murder rate in Alaska | Murder rate in Minnesota |\n",
        "|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n",
